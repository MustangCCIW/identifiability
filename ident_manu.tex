\begin{abstract}
\noindent Local sensitivity analyses and identifiable parameter subsets were used to describe numerical constraints of a hypoxia model for bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The sensitivity of state variables differed considerably with parameter changes, although most variables were responsive to changes in parameters that influenced planktonic growth rates and less sensitive to physical or chemical parameters.  Variation in sensitivity had a direct correspondence with identifiability, such that only small subsets of the complete parameter set had unique effects on the model output. Selecting parameters by decreasing sensitivity demonstrated that only eight of 51 total parameters had a sufficiently unique effect on model output for precise calibration.  As a result, parameter selection heuristics were used to identify parameters for model calibration that depended on combined effects on output, relative sensitivity of each parameter, and ecological categories for the biogeochemical equations. The calibrated \ac{zerod} unit of the hypoxia model had improved precision if sensitive parameters were included in an identifiable subset.  Extension of results to a three-dimensional grid of the Gulf of Mexico showed that sensitive parameters for the \ac{zerod} model translated to non-trivial changes in the areal estimates of hypoxia.

\section{Introduction}

Hypoxia formation in bottom waters of coastal oceans occurs primarily from excess nutrient inputs from land-based sources \citep{Justic87,Diaz95,Howarth96}.  These events are detrimental to aquatic organisms and have significant negative effects on economic resources derived from coastal ecosystems \citep{Lipton03,Diaz11}.  An understanding of the biological, physical, and chemical processes that influence hypoxic areas is a critical concern for mitigating and preventing these negative impacts.  Numerical ecosystem models are important tools that synthesize knowledge of ecosystem processes that contribute to hypoxia formation and for predicting the effects of proposed management activities or future scenarios \citep{Scavia04,Hagy07,Pauer16}.  Unlike statistical models with more generic structures, simulation and process-based models include explicit descriptions of relevant processes that are constrained by empirical or observational data relevant to the system of interest \citep[e.g.][]{Omlin01b,Eldridge10}.  These models are often coupled with hydrodynamic grids to provide spatially-explicit representations of patterns in three dimensions \citep{Warner05,Zhao10,Ganju16}. Combined hydrodynamic and bio-geo-chemical models have been developed specifically to describe hypoxic conditions on the \ac{lcs} in the northern \ac{gom} (\citealt{Fennel13,Obenour15,Pauer16}, \citetalias{LehrterIP}).  This area drains a significant portion of the continental United States through the \ac{marb} and is the second largest hypoxic area in the world \citep{Rabalais02}.  Understanding processes that contribute to the frequency and duration of hypoxic events remains a critical research goal for the region.  

The development of a model represents a tradeoff between characteristics expected from the output and information represented by the structural components. An ideal model is sufficiently generalizable across systems, provides results that are precise given the inputs, and includes components that are realistic descriptions of actual processes \citep{Levins66}. Given that these characteristics cannot be simultaneously achieved, models are developed in partial dependence of reality and theoretical constructs, completely separate from both, or dependent on one or the other \citep{Morrison99,Ganju16}.  These challenges are analagous to the well-known bias-variance tradeoff in statistical models that balances the competing objectives of over- and under-fitting to an observed dataset. Process-based models are more commonly imbalanced between reality and theory, such that most are over-parameterized in an attempt to completely describe reality \citep{Denman03,Nossent12,Petrucci14}.  Quantitative limitations of over-parameterization are analagous to degrees of freedom in standard statistical models as free parameters cannot be numerically estimated when constrained to an observed dataset \citep{Kirchner06}.  More importantly, over-parameterization can limit use across systems outside of the data domain and impose uncertainty in model predictions as realistic values for every variable may not be known or inaccurately applied from existing studies \citep{Durand02,Refsgaard07,Wade08}.

Model precision can be evaluated relative to the effects of initial conditions or the observed data used for calibration, changes in parameter values, or variation in the structural components (i.e., observational, parameter, or structural uncertainty) \citep{Beck87}.  Evaluating effects of parameter changes is by far the most common and simplest approach.  Although sensitivity analyses should be integrated with model development, parameters are often evaluated post-hoc as a form of `damage control' for further calibration.  This approach is sometimes called inverse modelling where results from sensitivity analyses are used to guide calibration or fit of the developed model to observations (\citealt{Soetaert10}, or confronting models with data, \textit{sensu} \citealt{Hilborn97}).  Parameter sensitivity analysis combined with inverse modelling necessarily involves questions of parameter `identifiability'.  Redundancies in parameter effects lead to unidentifiable models where calibration is empirically impossible (i.e., standard algorithms will not converge) or parameter values may be non-unique leading to the right answer for the wrong reason \citep{Kirchner06}. Unidentifiable parameter sets have effects on model output that can be undone or compensated for by alteration of other parameters.  Identifiability issues are not foreign to hypoxia or eutrophication models  \citep{Omlin01,Estrada10,Mateus15}, although there is a clear need for greater integration of these concepts in practice \citep{Fasham06}.

This study describes a parameter sensitivity and identifiability analysis of a \ac{zerod} unit of a larger spatial-temporal model of hypoxia dynamics on the \ac{lcs}.  The objectives were to provide a statistical approach that demonstrates numerical limitations of parameter sets for model calibration and provide a framework for selecting parameters within the identifiability constraints.  The specific goals were to \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item identify the parameters that have the greatest influence on state variables using local sensitivity analysis,
\item quantify the identifiability of subsets of the total parameter space based on sensitivity,
\item and provide a set of heuristics for choosing parameters based on sensitivity, identifiability, and parameter categories.
\end{inparaenum}
The \ac{zerod} model was calibrated with selected parameter subsets to demonstrate use of the selection heuristics to improve model precision.  Sensitive parameters for the \ac{zerod} model were also varied in the larger 3-dimensional model to demonstrate scalability the results. In addition to \ac{do}, other state variables that were evaluated included ammonium, \ac{chla}, irradiance, nitrate, \ac{pom}, \ac{dom}, and phosphorus. In general, we provide empirical results to support the assumption that models are generally over-parameterized and only a finite and smaller subset of the complete parameter set can be optimized.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Model description}

Hypoxic events, defined  as $<$2 mg L$^{-1}$ of \ac{do} ($<$ 64 mmol m$^{-3}$), occur seasonally in bottom waters in the northern \ac{gom}.  The hypoxic area averages 15,540 km$^2$ annually (1993-2015) with minimum concentrations observed from late spring to early fall.  Seasonal variation is strongly related to carbon and nutrient export from the \ac{marb} \citep{Lohrenz08,Bianchi10}, whereas hydrologic variation, currents, and wind patterns can affect vertical salinity gradients that contribute to hypoxia formation \citep{Wiseman97,Paerl98,Obenour15}. The \ac{cgem} was developed to describe hypoxia dynamics on the \ac{lcs} and includes elements from the Navy Coastal Ocean Model \citep{Martin00} for hydrodynamics and a biogeochemical model with multiple plankton groups, water-column metabolism, and sediment diagenesis \citep[\cref{fig:mod_schem},][]{Eldridge10}.  The hydrodynamic component of \ac{cgem} provides a spatially-explicit description of hypoxia using an orthogonal grid with an approximate horizontal resolution of 1.9 km$^2$ and twenty equally-spaced vertical sigma layers on the shelf.  The biogeochemical component includes equations for 36 state variables including six phytoplankton groups (with nitrogen and phosophorus quotas for each), two zooplankton groups, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, oxygen, silica, and multiple variables for dissolved and particulate organic matter from different sources.

The core unit of \ac{cgem} is FishTank, a \ac{zerod} model that implements the biogeochemical equations in \citet{Eldridge10} and does not include any advection, mixing, or sediment diagenesis. Although FishTank was developed for specific application in \ac{cgem}, it can easily be applied to other hydrodynamic grids. Results are based on time-dependent differential equations that describe energy flow between phytoplankton and zooplankton groups given nutrient uptake rates, organic matter inputs and losses, inherent optical properties, and temperature (\citealt{Penta08,Eldridge10}, see appendix in \citetalias{LehrterIP}). A total of 108 equations are estimated at each time step to return values for each of the 36 state variables described by the model.  In addition to the initial conditions, 251 parameter values for each of the equations are also supplied at model execution. Values for each of the parameters were based on estimates from the literature, field or laboratory-based measurements, or expert knowledge in absence of the former.  As such, a sensitivity analysis of parameter values is warranted given that, for example, literature or field-based estimates may not apply under all scenarios or expert knowledge is not completely certain \citep{Refsgaard07}.

The sensitivity of state variables to perturbations of all relevant parameters for the 108 equations was estimated using a five minute timestep with daily output from January 1\textsuperscript{st} to December 31\textsuperscript{st}, 2006. Irrelevant parameters were removed for several reasons; parameters were not relevant for the \ac{zerod} model (i.e., hydrodynamic parameters), were considered physical constants, or had no effect given initial conditions.  Additionally, FishTank includes six phytoplankton and two zooplankton groups to add complexity in community structure and foodweb dynamics. To remove obvious redundancies, the sensitivity analyses were conducted using only one phytoplankton and one zooplankton group.  The final set that was evaluated included 51 parameters that were further grouped into one of six categories based on applicable biogeochemical components of the model: optics ($n = $ 4 parameters), organic matter (12), phytoplankton (22), temperature (2), and zooplankton (11).  A full description of the model parameters is available as an appendix in \citetalias{LehrterIP}.  

\subsection{Local sensitivity analysis}

A local sensitivity analysis was performed by evaluating the change in state variables following perturbation of each parameter from its original value \citep{Soetaert10,RDCT17}. Parameters were individually perturbed by a 50\% increase of the original values and sensitivity $S$ was estimated for each time step $i$ given a change for parameter $j$ as:

\begin{equation} \label{sijeqn}
S_{ij} = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial \Theta_j}\cdot\frac{w_{\Theta_j}}{w_{y_i}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the estimate is based on the change in the predicted value for response variable $y$ divided by the change in the parameter $\Theta_j$ multiplied by the quotient of scaling factors $w$ for each.  The scaling factors, $w_{\Theta_j}$ for the parameter $\Theta_j$ and $w_{y_i}$ for response variable $y_i$, were set as the default value of the unperturbed parameter and the predicted value of $y_i$ after perturbation \citep{Soetaert10}.  Scaling makes the estimates unitless to compare model sensitivity to parameters and state variables that differ in relative magnitude.  Sensitivity values for all $j$ parameters were summarized as a single value across the time series from $i = 1$ to $n$ as $L1$:

\begin{equation} \label{l1}
L1 = \sum|S_{ij}|/n
\end{equation}

All parameters for each of the six equation categories (optics, organic matter, phytoplankton, temperature, and zooplankton) that had non-zero $L1$ were retained for identifiability analysis.  

\subsection{Identifiability and selecting parameter subsets}

The collinearity index $\gamma$ provides a measure of potential redundancies in the response of a state variable to changes in parameter values.  The index measures the linear dependence between sensitivity functions (i.e., $S_i$ for $j$ parameters) described above for parameter subsets and was estimated from the minimum eigenvector of the cross-product of a selected sensitivity matrix \citep{Brun01,Omlin01}:

\begin{equation} \label{gameq}
\gamma = \frac{1} {\sqrt{ \min \left(\rm{EV}[\mathit{\hat{S}}^\top \mathit{\hat{S}}]\right)}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\gamma$ ranges from one to infinity for perfectly identifiable (orthogonal) or unidentifiable (perfectly collinear) parameter sets.  The sensitivity functions were supplied as a matrix $\hat{S}$ with rows $i$ and columns $j$ (\cref{sijeqn}) that described deviations of predicted \ac{do} following perturbations of each parameter.  Thus, $\gamma$ can be estimated from results for any subset of parameter combinations. Sensitivity matrices were first normalized by dividing by the square root of the summed residuals \citep{Omlin01,Soetaert10}. Estimates of $\gamma$ greater than 10-15 suggest parameter sets are poorly identifiable \citep{Brun01,Omlin01}, meaning parameter values that maximize precision on a calibration dataset are inestimable by conventional optimization algorithms. An intuitive interpretation of $\gamma$ is provided by \citet{Brun01}, such that a change in a state variable caused by a change in one parameter can be offset by the fraction $1 - 1/\gamma$ by the remaining parameters.  That is, $\gamma = 10$ suggests the relative change in \ac{do} for an arbitrary parameter in the selected set can be compensated for by 90\% with changes in the other parameters. 

Parameter selection for model calibration must consider the competing objectives of increased precision with parameter inclusion and reduced identifiability as it relates to optimization.  An additional challenge is a large number of combinations of parameter sets, which complicates selection given sensitivity differences and desired ecological categories of each parameter (e.g., parameters for a group of related structural equations could be of interest).  \cref{fig:combnex} provides a simple graphic of the unique number of combinations that are possible for different subsets of `complete' parameter sets of different sizes (i.e., $n$ choose $k$ combinations, $n!/\left(k!\left(n-k\right)!\right)$).  The number of unique combinations increases with the total parameters in the set and is also maximized for moderate selections (e.g., selecting half the total).  For example, over 10$^{14}$ combinations are possible by selecting 25 parameters from a set of 50.

A set of heuristics was developed that addresses the tradeoff in model complexity and identifiability given the challenges described above \citep[see also][]{Wagener01}.  These rulesets were developed to select parameters with preference for those with high sensitivity and identifiability based on $\gamma < 15$ as an acceptable threshold for subsets (e.g., 93\% accountability between parameters).  Selection heurestics also recognized that parameter categories (i.e., optics, organic matter, phytoplankton, temperature, zooplankton) may have unequal preferences by users given desired application of the model.  For all selection heuristics, parameters were selected by decreasing sensitivity starting with the most sensitive until identifiability did not exceed $\gamma = 15$ where selections were \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item blocked within each of five parameter categories,
\item independent of parameter category,
\item or considering all categories equally.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Model calibration and scalability}

Selected parameter subsets from the seven heuristics were used to calibrate the \ac{zerod} model.  This analysis demonstrated that different parameter sets can produce model output with differing precision and calibration effort given
\begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item differences in variable sensitivity to parameters in each subset, 
\item differences in the parameters selected from different categories (heuristic difference), and 
\item differences in identifiability values.
\end{inparaenum}
Generally, this analysis was a proof of concept that the selection heuristics can lead to an `optimal' model by maximizing the balance between sensitivity and identifiability.  

A time series of \ac{do} from Weeks Bay, Alabama was used for model calibration.  Daily observations from January 1\textsuperscript{st},  2006 to January 1\textsuperscript{st}, 2007 at the Weeks Bay station of the Weeks Bay National Estuarine Reserve were used \citep{Wenner04}.  We chose this location because of the availability of data for model calibration compared to bottom waters in the northern \ac{gom} and the system exhibits hypoxia from eutrophication.  This application also provided a practical example of how the FishTank model could be calibrated using data from alternative locations.  Initial conditions for model input were modified to match conditions in Weeks Bay using observed water quality and nutrient data (all data from \url{http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/}).  The \ac{do} time series was filtered to reduce physical effects of the tidal advection component on the observed data (\textit{sensu} \citealt{Beck15b}).  As such, the filtered data were comparable to a time series with no physical advection to match conditions of the \ac{zerod} FishTank model with no hydrodynamic component. 

Each parameter subset was calibrated to most closely match the model output to the observed time series.  Parameter values were searched using the optim function in R that implemented the limited memory modification of the BFGS quasi-Newton method \citep{Byrd95,Nocedal06,RDCT17}.  This opimization scheme searches for values within the user-defined lower and upper bounds of each parameter.  We set the algorithm to search within +/- 50\% of the default parameter values.  While we recognize that `actual' parameter values could possibly extend beyond this range, constraining the values to the range tested herein was expected to produce output that was more interpretable within the context of the sensitivity functions defined above.  Moreover, precise limits on each parameter were less of a concern for the current analysis as our primary goal was to demonstrate differences in precision as a function of sensitivity and identifiability.  The optimal values for each parameter were identified based on convergence of the model results as a minimization of the \ac{rmse} between the observed and modelled data.    

As a final analysis, effects of parameter changes on the larger 3-dimensional model were evaluated to demonstrate that results from the \ac{zerod} FishTank model are scalable.  For simplicity, only the most sensitive parameter in each category was selected.  The \ac{cgem} model was run for one year using the default parameter conditions and by increasing each of the selected parameters by 50\%.  This produced six spatially-referenced time series (one default, five for each parameter change) from which changes in the daily hypoxic area (number of cells $<$ 64 mmol \ac{do}) were estimated.

\subsection{Local sensitivity analysis}

Local sensitivity analyses showed that \ac{do} was sensitive to perturbations in 38 of the 51 (75\% of total) parameters that were evaluated in FishTank (\cref{fig:sensalltile}, \cref{tab:dosens}). Within each parameter category, \ac{do} was sensitive to three parameters for optics (75\% of all optic parameters), eight for organic matter (67\%), 16 for phytoplankton (73\%), one for temperature (50\%), and 10 for zooplankton (91\%). Although \ac{do} had the greatest sensitivity to parameters in the zooplankton category (as percentage of total), the relative effects varied. Among all parameters, average sensitivity was $L1 = $ $9.2\times 10^{-3}$ with values ranging from $L1 = $ $8.34\times 10^{-8}$ for \textit{QminP} (phytoplankton) to $0.05$ for \textit{umax} (phytoplankton). Within categories (excluding temperature with one sensitive parameter), sensitivity ranged from $4.39\times 10^{-5}$ (\textit{astarOMA}) to $7.51\times 10^{-4}$ (\textit{astar490}) for optics, $4.17\times 10^{-4}$ (\textit{KNH4}) to $6.15\times 10^{-3}$ (\textit{KG1}) for organic matter, $8.34\times 10^{-8}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $0.05$ (\textit{umax}) for phytoplankton, and $3.69\times 10^{-5}$ (\textit{ZQp}) to $0.05$ (\textit{ZKa}) for zooplankton (\cref{tab:dosens}).  Average sensitivity values in each category were $L1 = $ $2.81\times 10^{-4}$ for optics, $2.17\times 10^{-3}$ for organic matter, $0.02$ for temperature, $0.01$ for phytoplankton, and $0.01$ for zooplankton.



Local sensitivity analyses for the additional state variables (ammonium, \ac{chla}, irradiance, nitrate, \ac{pom}, \ac{dom}, and phosphorus) had similar results as \ac{do} with some exceptions (\cref{fig:sensalltile,tab:nh4sens,tab:chlsens,tab:irrsens,tab:no3sens,tab:om1sens,tab:om2sens,tab:po4sens}).  All variables were sensitive to the same parameters as \ac{do} (38 of 51 evaluated), although average sensitivity differed between variables.  Average $L1$ ranged from $0.02$ for irradiance (\cref{tab:irrsens}) to $0.71$ for \ac{dom} (\cref{tab:om2sens}).  All average sensitivity values for the state variables were higher than the average for \ac{do} ($L1$ = $9.2\times 10^{-3}$).  For each variable, $L1$ ranged from $2.24\times 10^{-6}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $8.49$ (\textit{mA}) for ammonium (\cref{tab:nh4sens}), $1.38\times 10^{-6}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $13.94$ (\textit{mA}) for \ac{chla} (\cref{tab:chlsens}), $1.92\times 10^{-7}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $0.13$ (\textit{ZKa}) for irradiance (\cref{tab:irrsens}), $6.67\times 10^{-7}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $8.49$ (\textit{umax}) for nitrate (\cref{tab:no3sens}), $6.41\times 10^{-5}$ (\textit{KNH4}) to $7.22$ (\textit{mA}) for \ac{pom} (\cref{tab:om1sens}),  $7.41\times 10^{-5}$ (\textit{KNH4}) to $14.25$ (\textit{mA}) for \ac{dom} (\cref{tab:om2sens}), and $8.21\times 10^{-7}$ (\textit{QminP}) to $1.47$ (\textit{ZKa}) for phosphate (\cref{tab:po4sens}).  For the parameter categories, ammonium was most sensitive to phytoplankton parameters (average $L1$ = $0.8$ across all parameters in the category), \ac{chla} to phytoplankton ($L1$ = $1.14$), irradiance to zooplankton ($L1$ = $0.03$), nitrate to zooplankton ($L1$ = $1.06$), \ac{pom} to temperature ($L1$ = $0.86$), \ac{dom} to temperature ($L1$ = $1.48$), and phosphate to zooplankton ($L1$ = $0.31$).  Finally, average sensitivity between parameter categories independent of the state variables ranged from $8.38\times 10^{-3}$ for optics (average $L1$ across all variables) to $0.62$ for phytoplankton. 

\subsection{Identifiability of parameter subsets and selection rules}



The identifiability analyses suggested that many parameter subsets exceeded the thresholds of $\gamma = 10, 15$.  Parameter identifiability for \ac{do} decreased (increasing $\gamma$) at different rates with increasing size of parameter subsets depending on the parameter category or the number of top parameters that were selected (\cref{fig:identplo}). By category, identifiability was lowest for all combinations of parameter subsets in the phytoplankton ($60$\% of subsets less than $\gamma = 15$, $43$\% less than $\gamma = 10$) and zooplankton categories ($53.1$\% less than $\gamma = 15$, $40$\% less than $\gamma = 10$), whereas all combinations were identifiable for optics ($100$\% less than $\gamma = 15, 10$) and a majority identifiable for organic matter ($91.9$\% less than $\gamma = 15$, $76.5$\% less than $\gamma = 10$). Identifiability for parameters in the temperature category was not evaluated because \ac{do} was sensitive to only one parameter (i.e., $\gamma = 1$). Parameter combinations for choosing from the top, top two, top three, and top four parameters in each category together had decreasing identifiability with the increasing size of the selection pool (e.g., top one versus top four parameters, \cref{fig:identplo}).  The percentage of parameter subsets that were below the acceptable thresholds for identifiability was $100$\% less than $\gamma = 15, 10$ for the top parameter in each category, $90.6$\% and $80.7$\% for the top two, $80.7$\% and $70.9$\% for the top three, and $55.8$\% and $45.7$\% for the top four.  Results for the remaining state variables had similar patterns in identifiability with increasing size of parameter subsets and selection categories, although differences in identifiability between state variables was observed (\cref{fig:identploall}).  Most notably, nitrate was consistently the least identifiable variable (highest overall $\gamma$), whereas \ac{do} was most identifiable.



An evaluation of the effects of individual parameters on $\gamma$ suggested that some parameters had disproportionate effects on identifiability.  Based on $\gamma = 15$, \cref{fig:identplo} suggests that most parameter sets for organic matter were identifiable, regardless of how many parameters were selected (i.e., two through eight).  However, some subsets were not identifiable such that identification of one or more redundant parameters that are inflating $\gamma$ values could provide useful information.  \Cref{fig:exclex} shows an alternative view of identifiability of \ac{do} with exclusion and inclusion of individual parameters in different sets for the organic matter category.  As before, collinearity increases with more parameters in a subset, although the increase varies depending on which parameter was included or excluded from the set.  For example, inclusion of \textit{KNO3} in a parameter set almost always inflated $\gamma$.  All parameter subsets that did not include \textit{KNO3} were well below $\gamma = 15$, suggesting that exclusion of this parameter improves identifiability.  Interestingly, the inclusion of some parameters caused a reduction in $\gamma$, which contradicts the general rule that more parameters caused reduced identifiablity.  For example, parameter sets that included \textit{KGcdom} generally had lower $\gamma$ values relative to those that excluded the parameter.


Results for each of the three selection heuristics (blocked by parameter category, independent of category, all categories equally) applied to each state variable differed in the number of selected parameters and distribution of parameters within each category (\cref{tab:heurist1,tab:heurist2,tab:heurist3}).  In general, a corresponendence was observed between the number of parameters that were selected given the threhold of $\gamma = 15$ and relative identifiability between the state variables.  As noted above, nitrate was the least identifiable variable (\cref{fig:identploall}), whereas other variables (e.g., \ac{do}, irradiance) were more identifiable.  The constraints on identifiability between variables were demonstrated with the selection heuristics.  For example, heuristics for nitrate typically selected only one or two parameters that met the criteria as compared to more identifiable variables that included several parameters. Overall, the first selection heuristic demonstrated that the number of parameters chosen by parameter category differed independently of the state variables (\cref{tab:heurist1}). The number of selected parameters averaged across state variables in decreasing order was 4.25 parameters from the phytoplankton category, 3.5 from organic matter, 2.75 from optics, and 2.38 from zooplankton. The second and third selection heuristics (\cref{tab:heurist2,tab:heurist3}) were similar, although more parameters were generally selected for the third heuristic given equal importance between categories.

\subsection{Model calibration and scalability}



Calibration of parameter values for each of the seven selection heuristics (\cref{tab:heurist1,tab:heurist2,tab:heurist3})  produced model output that varied in precision and computational effort required to identify optimal values (\cref{tab:calib}).  As expected, the number of required iterations of the optimization algorithm to minimize \ac{rmse} of observed \ac{do} and model output varied in proportion to the number of parameters in a subset.  For example, only six iterations were required to optimize the single parameter selected for the temperature category, whereas 1530 iterations were required for the eight parameters selected independent of category.  No association was observed between collinearity ($\gamma$) and number of iterations or calibration.  Of the seven parameter subsets, selection independent of parameter category and equally within each category produced the largest reduction in \ac{rmse} values from the default output (starting \ac{rmse} $72.14$, reduction to $66.77$, $67.44$, respectively), whereas the optimal values for parameters in the Optics category had the smallest reduction ($72.12$).  Lower \ac{rmse} was associated with higher average sensitivity of a parameter subset.  Parameters selected only in the optics category had the highest \ac{rmse} and lowest average L1 ($2.81\times 10^{-4}$, three parameters), whereas parameters selected independent of category had the lowest \ac{rmse} and highest average L1 ($0.03$, eight parameters, \cref{tab:calib}). 



The estimated areal extent of bottom-water hypoxia using default parameter values for the 3-dimensional model peaked on August, 28\textsuperscript{th} at $1.19\times 10^{4}$ km$^2$ (\cref{fig:areachg}a, August mean area 8988 $\pm$ 551 km$^2$, \cref{fig:areachg}b). Increases in the top sensitive parameters for \ac{do} in each category (\cref{tab:dosens}) increased the estimated areal extent of hypoxia (Figs. \ref{fig:areachg}c, \ref{fig:areachg}e), with the exception of the parameter for optimum temperature of growth (\textit{Tref(nospA+nospZ)$_{p1}$}), which caused a decrease (mean difference from July default area -1070 $\pm$ 1161 km$^2$, \cref{fig:areachg}d).  The largest increase in area was caused by an increase in the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton (\textit{umax}), with the greatest increase occurring in July (monthly mean increase of 4109 $\pm$ 1085 km$^2$, \cref{fig:areachg}d).  Overall, changes in hypoxia extent were largest for parameters with large sensitivity values (i.e., L1 = $0.05$ for \textit{ZKa}, L1 = $0.05$ for \textit{umax}).

\section{Discussion}

Common goals in the application of biogeochemical models are to \begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape)]
\item accurately describe the system by matching predictions with observed data \citep{Reckhow90}, and 
\item provide a means of forecasting ecosystem condition with hypothesized management or environmental scenarios \citep{Clark01}. 
\end{inparaenum}
Although these objectives are the focus of most applications, the structural components and associated parameters of process-based models should secondarily provide insight of ecosystem processes that are driving observed changes.  This latter objective represents a more generic scientific purpose of modelling that extends beyond the benefits of describing and predicting change.  Modelers aim to identify universal principles that govern dynamics across systems and the constraint of model parameters to observations provides a means of supporting or refuting hypotheses \citep{Hilborn97,Kirchner06}.  Accordingly, this study provided a simple approach to use the effects of parameter perturbations on state variables to characterize identifiable parameter subsets that varied by selection criteria.  By doing so, we provided a simple and preliminary approach towards improved model refinement that begins to address more general purposes of model applications. Our specific results demonstrated that small parameter subsets relative to all sensitive parameters were within the identifiability thresholds described in the literature.  The identifiable parameter subsets varied considerably between state variables and the method for parameter selection.  Use of identifiable parameter subsets with sensitive parameters improved model precision and results for the smaller model were scalable to the 3-dimensional model.  In general, these results provide justification for the use of explicit parameter selection heuristics to improve model precision.

State variables were most sensitive to parameters in the phytoplankton and zooplankton categories, particularly the maximum growth rates (\textit{umax} for phytoplankton, \textit{Zumax} for zooplankton), mortality coefficient for phytoplankton (\textit{mA}), and the zooplankton half saturation coefficent for grazing (\textit{ZKa}). An increase in the growth rate of primary producers has the potential to increase oxygen concentration through photosynthetic processes, although increased production of organic matter is balanced with respiration and bacterial decomposition that reduce \ac{do} in the water column.  Similarly, increases in zooplankton abundance with increased growth rates causes a reduction in phytoplankton biomass through grazing, which is expected to further deplete pools of organic matter.  Most variables were also sensitive to variation in the half-saturation grazing coefficient which moderates the concentration of nutrients that support half the maximum grazing rate. Although the tradeoff between abundance, grazing, and decomposition is complex, the sensitivity of model state variables to parameters that directly control the abundance of primary producers is in agreement with empirical observations of factors that influence hypoxia dynamics on the \ac{lcs} \citep{Fahnenstiel95,Roelke00,Eldridge10}. The sensitivity of the model output to variation in other parameters that relate to physical and chemical properties of the system was of secondary importance to biological relationships.  That is, state variables were sensitive to changes in light and temperature parameters, although to a lesser extent than phytoplankton and zooplankton parameters.  As such, the differing sensitivities of state variables to parameters in each of the categories was not unexpected given general ecological relationships that are well understood and described by the model.    

A general conclusion from the identifiability analyses is that only limited subsets of parameters were identifiable within the constraints of local sensitivity analyses. These results support previous studies that have suggested similarly small subsets of parameters can be identified using traditional calibration schemes \citep[e.g.,][]{Wheater86,Ye97,Omlin01}.  In addition to \ac{cgem}, these conclusions have relevance for other biogeochemical models that include numerous parameters and structural equations to characterize processes in the model domain.  A general conclusion is that less complex models could potentially be beneficial given that only a small subset of parameters is identifiable and that ecosystem processes may in fact be sufficiently characterized with few parameters \citep{Ye97}.  Conversely, others have argued that model complexity is not in itself a disadvantage when parsimony is not the sole arbitrator of model structure \citep{Reichert97}. Over-parameterization can be useful if processes have importance that were not evaluated during model identification.  Single objective functions that maximize model precision with identifiable parameters may also provide an incomplete characterization of model worth, which has prompted the development of probability-based models of hypoxia that explicitly include uncertainty in model components \citep[e.g.][]{Obenour15}.  Our results demonstrated that approximately 75\% of the evaluated parameters had an effect on the eight state variables, whereas \ac{cgem} includes a total of 36 variables and multiple plankton groups, not all of which have immediate concern for understanding hypoxia. The redundancies identified with the sensitivity analyses are only problematic if the primary interest is, for example, \ac{do} dynamics.  Moreover, the proposed selection heuristics provide flexibility for choosing different parameters with the assumption that those chosen depend on the research or management question. 

Results from the identifiability analyses provided additional insight into the interactions of parameters in large biogeochemical models.  First, identifiability of parameter subsets was not related to the sensitivity of individual variables. As noted above, an identifiable parameter is one that has a unique effect on model predictions that cannot be compensated for or undone by changing other parameters. The magnitude of the effect of a parameter has no bearing on identifiability, which further complicates the selection of parameters for calibration.  Although identifiability is the primary limiting factor in choosing a set, the relative sensitivities are more important for the decision to include or exclude individual parameters.  For example, \cref{tab:calib,fig:areachg} demonstrated that parameter sets with sensitive parameters had improved model precision and that these parameters had affects that translated to the larger model. Our analysis addressed this challenge by presenting multiple selection criteria for identifiable parameter sets that prioritized the most sensitive parameters during the selection process.  Similarly, identifiability was not always related to the number of parameters in a set. Although the overwhelming trend was decreasing identifiability with more parameters, the unique effects of including an individual parameter with an existing set often reduced the $\gamma$ estimate. For example, \cref{fig:exclex} showed that including \textit{KGcdom}, \textit{KO2}, or \textit{nitmax} in parameter sets more often reduced $\gamma$ relative to sets that excluded the parameters.  These examples demonstrate the complex interactions of parameter changes on variable response, highlighting the need to consider the combined and individual effects of parameters on identifiability. The selection criteria proposed in our above analyses can facilitate parameter selection and also provide diagnostic tools to identify parameters with disproportionate effects on $\gamma$.

\subsection{Recommendations and conclusions}

An evaluation of sensitivity and identifiability of relevant parameter sets is a preliminary and simplistic approach to improving model predictions.  In general, uncertainty analyses that lead to improved models are ultimately expected to increase our understanding of properties defining ecological relationships.  The extension of simple parameter sensitivity analyses to the generalization of ecosystem properties requires additional analysis and model refinement. Further, the utility of a specific model depends on the question and objective for application to a specific system.  For the above analysis, the FishTank model, as part of the larger \ac{cgem} application, was evaluated in the context of hypoxia effects on ecosystem condition and function.  Our results have shown that relatively small subsets of parameters are identifiable given the complexity of the model, and as a result, we have provided a general approach to select parameter subsets depending on the ecological context (i.e., selection by parameter category, selection for specific state variables). We further demonstrated the effects of selected subsets on model precision and the potential for scalability to larger spatial-temporal models. Thus, the results described above have relevance for further model refinement with the specific goal of better understanding ecological dynamics that moderate hypoxia on the northern \ac{gom}.  However, the general principles of sensitivity and parameter identifiability have broad applicability beyond this context and we argue that such methods should be more universally applied as an initial approach to quantify numerical constraints of biogeochemical models.  

Specific approaches can be used to improve and build on the results presented herein, in addition to the more general considerations above.  The effects of structural or observational uncertainty could be evaluated as an extension of the analyses presented above. For example, the sensitivity of \ac{do} to variation in the half-saturation constants for phytoplankton (the concentration supporting half the maximum uptake rate of nutrients) could vary given the initial nutrient concentrations \citep{Eppley69}. Further, changes in the ratio between nitrogen and phosphorus could affect the sensitivity of state variables to parameter changes depending on the limiting nutrient.  A more challenging analysis is an evaluation of the effects of structural components on model output, which requires exclusion or inclusion of explicit biogeochemical equations. Fortunately, the FishTank model includes several `switches' that allow users to change the governing equations that estimate state variables, such as switches that `turn on' different structural equations for light attenuation in the water column.  This design is uncommon in biogeochemical models and could be leveraged for an evaluation of structural uncertainty. As such, our analysis of parameter sensitivity and identifiabilty could be combined with an evaluation of observational and structural uncertainty for a more complete characterization of the model, having implications for understanding drivers of hypoxia in coastal waters.
